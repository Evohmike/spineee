            <h2>Faith Migwi</h2>
            <p>Faith Migwi of Manciny Designs is another self-taught designer with a great reputation in the Kenyan fashion industry. She started her journey in 2012 founding 4 different brands; Eqo-chic, an eco-friendly brand that used recycled materials to make bags, Manciny, a men’s wear brand, Nyadhi, a women’s wear brand followed by The Urban Gentleman that provides styling (and design) services for men. She has currently niched down to concentrate on the male segment, which is inspired by contemporary Africa.</p>
            <span class="aboutfaith">As we wondered ourselves, Manciny is not a common name but there is a reason this lovely lady has adopted that name. Her real name is Faith Wairimu Migwi, as she jokingly stated her “Kenya government names, her MPESA names.” Manciny is a nickname that grew on her friends 11 years ago stemming from her love for one of the characters from an old TV show called Melrose Place whose name was Michael Mancini (with an i). The name finally stuck and over the years she has come to love it so Manciny Migwi it is. “When I was venturing into fashion, it was either going to be called Migwi or Manciny so the name stuck and I chose Manciny.”
            <br>
            Her affair with fashion is, as she put it, one of those things you just have. When she decided to start professionally two years ago in May 2012, she began as an eco fashionista doing bags from recycled plastic and began her brand Eqo-Chic. “Eqo-Chic existed before the brand Manciny. I did not want to be stuck in that eco-box so I thought of having an entire fashion house that has eco as part of it.” Eco fashion derives from her appreciation for nature, order, justice and awareness of her carbon footprint. Manciny believes that fashion does not necessarily need to be fast fashion and add on to the waste that already exists so “why not recycle or repurpose something.” Maniciny is still trying to figure out the means to apply eco-chic to apparel but it is a work on progress.</span>
